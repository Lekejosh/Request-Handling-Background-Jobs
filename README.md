## Introduction
The introduction section of the article provides an overview of the challenges associated with handling requesting and running backend jobs together in a backend applications and explains how to help solve these challenges.

## Prerequisites
This section outlines the prerequisites for following the tutorial, including knowledge of Node.js and npm


## Running the Application

## Installation
Before getting started with the code, you need to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages and libraries to run the project successfully.

## Getting Started with the Code
You can get started with the code by reviewing the files and directories in the project. The main application code can be found in the `src/` directory.

## Build and Run the Project
To build and run the project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup your .env**: Create a file name `.env`, check the `.env.sample` to know how this file looks like.

1. **Build the Project**: Run the following command to build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will compile the source code and create the necessary output files in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Run the Project**: After the project is built, you can start the application by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the Node.js application. Use Postman to test your routes
